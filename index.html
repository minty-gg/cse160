            <p><u>Notes to Grader for Asg3B:</u></p>
            <p> - Was not able to implement add/delete blocks feature T-T</p>
            <p> - Camera movements and mouse movements implemented (the mouse one is a bit janky but pls have mercy T-T)</p>
            <p> - (also camera movements) Added panUp and panDown rotations and shifting up and down on map</p>
            <p> - Added button that takes you to Oshawott if you get really lost in maze and a button to help you reset your position</p>
            <p> - Story to my world: Oshawott is lost in a maze D: we need to find him!</p>
            <p> - Wow factor: a really cool hedge maze and a really cool and cute and awesome lil Oshawott awaits you at the heart of the maze :D </p>

            <p><u>Notes to Grader for Asg5B:</u></p>
            <p> - shapes: heart, cube, sphere, cone, and torus knot</p>
            <p> - lighting: directional light, ambient light, and hemisphere light</p>
            <p> - textured skybox: cloudy sky</p>

            <br> 
            <p><u>Notes to Grader for Asg4:</u></p>
            <p> - lighting is there, might have to get closer with the controls</p>
            <p> - for blocky animal, the ears and arms were not rendered with UV lights or normals so that's why the color doesn't change on different sides</p>
            <p> - was not able to implement spot light :c</p>
